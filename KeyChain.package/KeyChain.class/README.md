A KeyChain is a holder for username/password.
It can be queried by the system to prevent the user to be forced to set his or her password each time.

keys have this structure:

|- group1 (by example squeaksource) 	-> (username -> password)
|- group2 (by example smalltalkhub) 		-> (username -> password)

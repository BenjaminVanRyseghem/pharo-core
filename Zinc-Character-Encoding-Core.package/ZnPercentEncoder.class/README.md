I am ZnPercentEncoder.
I implement RFC 3986 percent encoding and decoding.

All characters that are not part of a safe set are encoded using a percent (%) followed by a two digit hexadecimal number of a byte value. Non-ASCII characters are first encoded, normally using UTF-8.

My #encode: and #decode: messages work from String to String.

My decoder additionally will accept + as an encoding for a space.

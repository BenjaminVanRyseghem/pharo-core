I appear when there is an error while trying to build a menu from pragmas.

I include items to:
* Debug: give the user an opportunity to see and correct the error
* Explain: why they're seeing a different menu
* Custom: clients can add items to me by implementing #fallbackMenuOn:. Browse implementors for examples.

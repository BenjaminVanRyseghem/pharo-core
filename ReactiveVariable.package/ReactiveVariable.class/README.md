I am a class holding any object inside its unique instance variable. 
Each time the instance variable value changes, an announcement is emitted. 

The instance variable is accessed through `value` and `value:` while the registration is done by `whenChangedDo: aBlock`. 

In addition, infinite loops of propagation are prevented. 
Use case: you have two lists A, and B, and you want to keep their selection synchronised. 
So when A selection changes, you set B selection. 
But since B selection changes, you set A selection, and so onâ€¦ 

This case is prevented by the use of a `lock` variable.

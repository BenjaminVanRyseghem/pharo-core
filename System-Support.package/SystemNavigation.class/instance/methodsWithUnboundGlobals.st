methodsWithUnboundGlobals
	"This says that for any global, it should match either the class's notion of what bindingOf: the key is, or bindingOf: should be nil and the binding should be in Undeclared. If the class answers a different binding through bindingOf: or answers no binding and the binding is not in Undeclared then the variable in the method is wrong.
	For a clean image the result should be empty. If it is not empty, evaluating Compiler recompileAll probably solves the problem. However, we should investigate why the method gets an incorrect state."

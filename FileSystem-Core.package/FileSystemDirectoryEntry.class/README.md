creation
	The creation date and time, stored as number seconds since the 
	Smalltalk epoch.
	
modification
	The modification date and time, number seconds since the Smalltalk epoch.
	
isDirectory 
	True if my data pertains to a directory, false if a file.
	
size
	Size in bytes for a file, 0 for a directory.

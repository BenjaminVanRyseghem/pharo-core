I traverse the filesystem in breadth-first order. Given this hierarchy:

alpha
	beta
	gamma
delta
	epsilon

I would visit the nodes in the following order:  alpha, delta, beta, gamma, epsilon.

I use my work instance variable as a queue, adding nodes to be visited to the end and retrieving them from the beginning.

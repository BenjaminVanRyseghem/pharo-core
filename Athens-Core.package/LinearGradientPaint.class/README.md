I represent a linear gradient paint.
My start and stop points defining 
the position and direction of gradient fill 
in user space coordinates,
so that the ramp color at 0 maps to starting point
and ramp color at 1 maps to stop point of linear gradient.



Also check the comment of my superclass to know better how and when you can use me.

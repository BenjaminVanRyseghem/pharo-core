I represent a radial gradient paint.

The center point and radius defining a circle where gradient will be drawn in user space coordinates.

The gradient's ramp color at 0 maps to the focal point and ramp color at 1 maps to the edge of the circle,
interpolating colors in between.

Also check the comment of my superclass to know better how and when you can use me.

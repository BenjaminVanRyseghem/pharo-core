"Step 17: Self-intersecting paths and how they are filled.


There is a simple algorithm to determine whether given point will be filled or not: 
 - take an arbitrary point, infinitely distant from path interior and connect it with a point under the question.
 - count how many times the resulting ray intersects with path segments
 - if number of intersections is odd, then given point will be filled
 - if number of intersections is even, then given point will NOT be filled

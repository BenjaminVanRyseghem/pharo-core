"Step 13: Building complex shapes using paths.

For complex and large paths, building it every time could be ineffective and computationally intensive. 
Instead you can use surface factory method (#createPath:) to create a path object
at any point, and use it later, whenever you see fit.

Note, that since we're not using canvas, it is not necessary to put path creation inside #drawDuring: method.

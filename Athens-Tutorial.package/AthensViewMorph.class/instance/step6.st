	"Step 6: Transforming coordinate space.
	
	There are two transformation matrices which control coordinate space:
	   - path transform
	   - paint transform
	
	Both transformations represented by affine transformation matrices.
	(See AthensAffineTransform class for details).
	
	Accessing path transform:
	
	  <canvas> pathTransform
	
	Accessing paint transform:
	
	  <canvas> paintTransform

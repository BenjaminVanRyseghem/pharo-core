	"This test tests the scrolling values of a scrollpane. We create a reeeeeally big (enormous) morph, to be sure its size is bigger than the screen and therefore its enclosing window has scrollbars.
	When screen sizes become bigger, you should increase the value, or fix morphic, what happens first :).

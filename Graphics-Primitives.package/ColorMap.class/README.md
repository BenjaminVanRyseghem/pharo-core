I'm a transformation of pixel values. I apply up to four masks and shits to compute the transformed pixel value.

I'm used when applying a BitBlt transfer, whenever pixels from a source to a destination have diferent depths. For further information refer to BitBlt class comments.

To see me in action evaluate: BitBlt exampleColorMap

MorphMargin represents a margin (for now of rectangle-based operations).

It can be expressed as different objects:

- A number. When specified using a number, it sets all the four values to be the same.

- A point. When specified as a point, pairs top/bottom and left/right take their values from a point y and x. 

- Four numbers. They represent all the four directions.

- A rectangle. (do not use this version because it is proposed just for migration and it may force you to crea)


In the future we may add an API (#margin) for singular margin.

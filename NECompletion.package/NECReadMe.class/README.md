NEC is based on the eCompletion package developed by Ruben Baker. We thank Ruben for having release this code in MIT. It was maintained by lukas renggli, damien Cassou and a couple of other cool developers.

The current version (NEC) relies on some methods that re available in Pharo1.4. In addition the extensions made to shout has been moved to the Shout package.

The goal of thise new version is to make sure that OCompletion can be just expressed as an extension of ECompletion and not a full copy of the ecompletion.

This package relies on Shout.

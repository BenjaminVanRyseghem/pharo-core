I am used to hold a parsed function signature, describing a C function.
Since all C functions having return type, arguments and name (unless it anonymous one), 
same structure can be used to hold an information about it in my instances.
However, what objects used to represent types and arguments is up to code generator.

Instance Variables:
	returnType <Object>
	functionName	<String>
	arguments	<SequenceableCollection>

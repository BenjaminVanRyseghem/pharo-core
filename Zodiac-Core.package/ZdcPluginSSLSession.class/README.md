I am ZdcPluginSSLSession, an object managing the secure communication between two parties.

I am a ZdcAbstractSSLSession.

I am a wrapper for the SqueakSSL plugin.

I am probably too primitive to be used directly, see ZnSecureSocketStream for a higher level client.

Ackowledgement: based on the original SqueakSSL code.

Modifications to a high-level class have an impact on the related low-level structures. There are two modification models that transform the high-level model into concrete low-level modifications models, the method modification model and the instance modification model. Both models list for every field, whether it was added, removed, or shifted to a new position.

Instance Variables:
	slotShift	<Integer>
	modificationMap	<(Collection of: AbstractFieldModification)>

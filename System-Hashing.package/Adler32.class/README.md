The Adler32 checksum algorithm was developed by Mark Adler for his ZLib algorithm. It is defined in IETF RFC 1950: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950#page-10.

The purpose of this class is mainly grouping as the ZipPlugin already implements Adler32. See also the comment in #update:from:to:in:

Note that Adler32 is not a CRC, strictly speaking.

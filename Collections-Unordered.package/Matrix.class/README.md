I represent a two-dimensional array.

Structure:
  nrows : a non-negative integer saying how many rows there are.
  ncols : a non-negative integer saying how many columns there are.
  contents : an Array holding the elements in row-major order.  That is, for a 2x3 array
    the contents are (11 12 13 21 22 23).  


Element-wise matrix arithmetic works; you can freely mix matrices and numbers but
don't try to mix matrices and arrays (yet).
Matrix multiplication, using the symbol +* (derived from APL's +.x), works between
(Matrix or Array) +* (Matrix or Array).  Don't try to use a number as an argument of +*.
Matrix * Number and Number * Matrix work fine, so you don't need +* with numbers.

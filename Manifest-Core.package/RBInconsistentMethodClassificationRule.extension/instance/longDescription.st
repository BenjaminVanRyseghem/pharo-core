	^ 'This smell arises when a method protocol is not equivalent to the one defined in the superclass of such method class. All methods should be put into a protocol (method category) that is equivalent to the one of the superclass, which is a standart style in Smalltalk. Furthermore, methods which are extended in the superclass are ignored, since they may have different protocol name. Pay attention when you apply automatic recategorisation because it may move method in antoher package if the method is defined in the superclass as an extension.'

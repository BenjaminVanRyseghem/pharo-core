I visit each node in the abstract syntax tree while growing and shrinking a scope chain. Each method and block node is linked with its corresponding scope object, and each variable def and ref is linked with its corresponding OCVariable. Exceptions are raised for undefined variable references and so on (see subclasses of OCSemanticWarning).

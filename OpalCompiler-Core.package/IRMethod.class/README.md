I am a method in the IR (intermediate representation) language consisting of IRInstructions grouped by IRSequence (basic block).  The IRSequences form a control graph (therefore I only have to hold onto the starting sequence).  #compiledMethod will convert me to a CompiledMethod.  #methodNode will convert me back to a parse tree.

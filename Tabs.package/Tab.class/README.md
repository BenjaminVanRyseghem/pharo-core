I represent a simple tab
I have a IconicListItem which wrap my label and my icon.
I also have a morph to display when selected.
This morph can in fact be anything responding to #asMorph. Moreover it could be a block for lazy initialization.

I also have a state representing if I am selecting or not, enabled or not, etc

I am a tool to inspect live events .

If you want to inspect events generated by an announcer without a priori knowledge about the kind and frequency of events, you can always open a spy on an announcer to track its events. 

 announcer open 
or 

 AnnouncementSpy openOn: announcer 
This opens a window which displays the sequence of events emitted by the announcer (after the spy has been launched). You can open/inspect each event individually using the contextual menu. you can also clear the list view. 

Try it on World announcer open (in Pharo 1.1 or later), then add and close windows to see events generated.

A FLDictionaryCollectionCluster is a special optional cluster that rather than using the default (variable object) serialization, uses #keysAndValuesDo: to iterate objects and #add: during materialization. This way we avoid analyzing/serializing lots of nil. Also, the rehash is not needed. So far we use it for Dictionary, IdentityDictionary and MethodDictionary.

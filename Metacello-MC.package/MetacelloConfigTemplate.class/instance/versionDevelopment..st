	<version: 'dev' imports: #('1.0-baseline') >
	
	"Update this configuration regulrarly with intermediate releases.
	If a version is more stable or should stay accessible copy this 'dev' definition and give it a proper version name on its own.
	For example, in this case you might want to split a new version '1.1' by copying over this definition."

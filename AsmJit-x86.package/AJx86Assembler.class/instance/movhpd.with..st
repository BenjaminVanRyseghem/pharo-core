	"Move High Packed Double-FP Value
	Pseudo Code
-----------
(* MOVHPD instruction for memory to XMM move *)
DEST[127:64] = SRC;
(* DEST[63:0] unchanged *)
(* MOVHPD instruction for XMM to memory move *)
DEST = SRC[127:64];

Description
-----------
Moves a double-precision floating-point value from the source operand
(second operand) to the destination operand (first operand). The source
and destination operands can be an XMM register or a 64-bit memory
location. This instruction allows a double-precision floating-point
value to be moved to and from the high quadword of an XMM register and
memory. It cannot be used for register to register or memory to memory
moves. When the destination operand is an XMM register, the low
quad-word of the register remains unchanged.

In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction to
access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).

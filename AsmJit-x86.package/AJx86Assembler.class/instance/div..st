div: aDestination
	"Unsigned Divide
	Description
-----------
Divides unsigned the value in the AX, DX:AX, EDX:EAX, or RDX:RAX
registers (dividend) by the source operand (divisor) and stores the
result in the AX (AH:AL), DX:AX, EDX:EAX, or RDX:RAX registers. The
source operand can be a general-purpose register or a memory location.
The action of this instruction depends on the operand size
(dividend/divisor). Division using 64-bit operand is available only in
64-bit mode.

Non-integral results are truncated (chopped) towards 0. The remainder is
always less than the divisor in magnitude. Overflow is indicated with
the \#DE (divide error) exception rather than with the CF flag.

In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits. Use
of the REX.R prefix permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Use
of the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits. In 64-bit mode when
REX.W is applied, the instruction divides the unsigned value in RDX:RAX
by the source operand and stores the quotient in RAX, the remainder in
RDX.

and limits. See the following table.

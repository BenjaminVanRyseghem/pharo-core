FPUStatusWord = SRC[FPUStatusWord];

Description
-----------
Loads the complete x87 FPU operating environment from memory into the
FPU registers. The source operand specifies the first byte of the
operating-environment data in memory. This data is typically written to
the specified memory location by a FSTENV or FNSTENV instruction.

The FPU operating environment consists of the FPU control word, status
word, tag word, instruction pointer, data pointer, and last opcode.
Figures 8-9 through 8-12 in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures
Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1, show the layout in memory of the
loaded environment, depending on the operating mode of the processor
(protected or real) and the current operand-size attribute (16-bit or
32-bit). In virtual-8086 mode, the real mode layouts are used.

The FLDENV instruction should be executed in the same operating mode as
the corresponding FSTENV/FNSTENV instruction.

If one or more unmasked exception flags are set in the new FPU status
word, a floating-point exception will be generated upon execution of the
next floating-point instruction (except for the no-wait floating-point
instructions, see the section titled 'Software Exception Handling' in
Chapter 8 of the Intel®64 and IA-32 ArchitecturesSoftware Developer's
Manual, Volume 1). To avoid generating exceptions when loading a new
environment, clear all the exception flags in the FPU status word that
is being loaded.

If a page or limit fault occurs during the execution of this
instruction, the state of the x87 FPU registers as seen by the fault
handler may be different than the state being loaded from memory. In
such situations, the fault handler should ignore the status of the x87
FPU registers, handle the fault, and return. The FLDENV instruction will
then complete the loading of the x87 FPU registers with no resulting
context inconsistency.

This instruction's operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit
mode.

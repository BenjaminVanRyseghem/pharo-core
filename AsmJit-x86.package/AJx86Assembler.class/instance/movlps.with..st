	"Move Low Packed Single-FP Values
	Pseudo Code
-----------
(* MOVLPD instruction for memory to XMM move *)
DEST[63:0] = SRC;
(* DEST[127:64] unchanged *)
(* MOVLPD instruction for XMM to memory move *)
DEST = SRC[63:0];

Description
-----------
Moves two packed single-precision floating-point values from the source
operand (second operand) and the destination operand (first operand).
The source and destination operands can be an XMM register or a 64-bit
memory location. This instruction allows two single-precision
floating-point values to be moved to and from the low quadword of an XMM
register and memory. It cannot be used for register to register or
memory to memory moves. When the destination operand is an XMM register,
the high quadword of the register remains unchanged.

In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction to
access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).

frstor: aMemoryOperand
	"Restore x87 FPU State
	Description
-----------
Loads the FPU state (operating environment and register stack) from the
memory area specified with the source operand. This state data is
typically written to the specified memory location by a previous
FSAVE/FNSAVE instruction.

The FPU operating environment consists of the FPU control word, status
word, tag word, instruction pointer, data pointer, and last opcode.
Figures 8-9 through 8-12 in the IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32 Architectures
Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1, show the layout in memory of the
stored environment, depending on the operating mode of the processor
(protected or real) and the current operand-size attribute (16-bit or
32-bit). In virtual-8086 mode, the real mode layouts are used. The
contents of the FPU register stack are stored in the 80 bytes
immediately following the operating environment image.

The FRSTOR instruction should be executed in the same operating mode as
the corresponding FSAVE/FNSAVE instruction.

If one or more unmasked exception bits are set in the new FPU status
word, a floating-point exception will be generated. To avoid raising
exceptions when loading a new operating environment, clear all the
exception flags in the FPU status word that is being loaded.

This instruction's operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit
mode.

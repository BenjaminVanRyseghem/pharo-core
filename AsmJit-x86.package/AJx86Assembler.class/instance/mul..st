mul: aDestination
	"Unsigned Multiply
	Description
-----------
Performs an unsigned multiplication of the first operand (destination
operand) and the second operand (source operand) and stores the result
in the destination operand. The destination operand is an implied
operand located in register AL, AX or EAX (depending on the size of the
operand); the source operand is located in a general-purpose register or
a memory location. The action of this instruction and the location of
the result depends on the opcode and the operand size as shown in the
following table.

The result is stored in register AX, register pair DX:AX, or register
pair EDX:EAX (depending on the operand size), with the high-order bits
of the product contained in register AH, DX, or EDX, respectively. If
the high-order bits of the product are 0, the CF and OF flags are
cleared; otherwise, the flags are set.

In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits. Use
of the REX.R prefix permits access to additional registers (R8 - R15).
Use of the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits.

See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data
and limits.

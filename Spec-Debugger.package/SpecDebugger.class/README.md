A SpecDebugger is a UI build in Spec that provides Smalltalk debugging functionality by using a DebugSession.

All the debugging logic is in DebugSession and the corresponding debugging actions. SpecDebugger only provides a graphical interface to access that functionality. The debugging actions are managed by the toolbar widget; the stack and all its related actions are managed by the stack widget.
